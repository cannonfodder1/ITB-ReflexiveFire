Into the Breach Mod - Reflexive Fire

Normally in the game, the player's units attack on the player turn and the enemy units attack on the enemy turn. This is a foundation mod that I made that allows other mod authors to create special enemy units that can attack on the player's turn. This system had to be built from the ground up, as the game throws a fit in all sorts of ways when your units take damage on their turn. Paticularily, the game features an Undo Move button to allow players to go back a move if they didn't like the result. This required some hacky solutions to allow Reflex Fire shots to be undone. An example that utilizes this mod can be found in the Examples folder in this repository and in the ITB-HiveWar repository.
